My solution for Frontend Mentor challenge - Four card feature section

Live: https://pattykovash.github.io/frontendmentor_challenge_four-card-feature-section/

Weapons of Choice:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (no frameworks, Flexbox Layout, mobile first)
- Adobe Photoshop
- Chrome Extension: Page Ruler Redux

Notes:

- Added a link to a page displaying the static design JPG
- Added some animations for fun
- It was more difficult to get pixel measurements of the page after a width of 500px. The ruler extension does not work when in Chrome's dev responsive mode.
- Kept the background the same color for smaller screen sizes instead of white like the design.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Source design is provided as a JPG static format.

Use any tools to help complete the challenge.
